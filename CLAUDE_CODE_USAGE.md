# Claude Code Usage

## Setup
- **Version**: Claude Code CLI (Sonnet 4.5, Model ID: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- **Time spent**: Approximately 90-120 minutes
- **Approach**: Mixed (Strategic planning by user, autonomous execution by Claude Code)
- **COBOL Knowledge Before Starting**: Intermediate - had practical COBOL experience and prior use of Cursor/Copilot for MVPs

---

## What I Did

### Step 1: Strategy & Planning (5 minutes)
**Goal**: Understand the COBOL code and plan the migration validation approach

**What I did**:
1. Opened `legacy_app.cob` in the IDE
2. Asked Claude Code: *"First explain me what should be my steps and strategy for migration"*

**What Claude Code did**:
- Read the entire COBOL file (220 lines)
- Analyzed three core operations: REGISTER-USER, LOGIN-USER, CHANGE-PASSWORD
- Identified data structures: USER-TABLE (100 entries), SESSION-TABLE (50 entries)
- Extracted key behaviors: 20-char strings, 6-digit tokens, error messages
- Provided 5-phase strategic plan:
  1. Behavior Documentation
  2. Black-Box Test Suite
  3. Evaluation Framework
  4. Reference Implementation
  5. Validation & Documentation

---

### Step 2: Creating Behavioral Specification (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Document exact COBOL behaviors that must be preserved

**What I did**:
1. Asked Claude Code to create `behavioral_spec.md`
2. Reviewed the file in IDE
3. Validated completeness by asking: *"Are all these cases covered? Any other possibility of any edge case left? Where are details of full DB?"*
4. Selected line 207 in IDE to point out missing details

**What Claude Code did**:
- Generated comprehensive behavioral specification
- Initially created with 18 edge cases
- After my validation prompt, found 7 additional edge cases:
  - Duplicate check priority when DB is full
  - String truncation (20 vs 21+ chars)
  - Empty password handling
  - Multiple password changes on same session
- Added dedicated "Full Database Capacity Behavior" section with COBOL line references

---

### Step 3: Building Test Suite (20 minutes)
**Goal**: Create comprehensive black-box tests and grading system

**What I did**:
1. Said: *"Lets move with next phase"*
2. Let Claude Code create `behavior_tests.py`, `evaluate_refactor.py`, `modern_app.py`, and `run_evaluation.py` autonomously

**What Claude Code did**:
- Created 27 comprehensive black-box tests covering:
  - 7 registration tests
  - 7 login tests
  - 7 password change tests
  - 4 string handling tests
  - 2 integration tests
- Built automated grading system with A-F scoring
- Generated reference Python implementation with exact behavioral match
- Created master test runner

---

### Step 4: Testing & Validation (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Run tests and fix any issues

**What I did**:
- Let Claude Code run: `python run_evaluation.py`
- No manual intervention needed

**What Claude Code did**:
- Executed tests automatically
- Encountered Windows encoding errors (Unicode characters in docstrings)
- **Self-corrected**: Replaced all emoji characters with ASCII equivalents
- Fixed issues across multiple files
- Re-ran tests automatically
- Achieved 100% pass rate (27/27 tests)

**Commands Claude Code ran**:
```bash
cd "d:\AI Program\COBOL Migration" && python run_evaluation.py
cd "d:\AI Program\COBOL Migration" && python run_evaluation.py 2>&1 | tail -40
```

---

### Step 5: Documentation (10 minutes)
**Goal**: Create methodology and usage documentation

**What I did**:
1. Said: *"Lets move with next phase"* (for METHODOLOGY.md and README.md)

**What Claude Code did**:
- Generated `METHODOLOGY.md` explaining the complete approach
- Created `README.md` with project overview and quickstart guide
- Analyzed our conversation history to create this usage documentation

---

## How I Used Claude Code to Understand COBOL

**Approach**: Opened `legacy_app.cob` in IDE and asked high-level questions

**Key prompts**:
- "Understand what this COBOL code does"
- "Build tests that validate ANY Python version preserves behavior"

**What Claude Code extracted**:
1. **Operations**: REGISTER-USER (lines 107-136), LOGIN-USER (lines 138-173), CHANGE-PASSWORD (lines 175-215)
2. **Data Structures**: USER-TABLE (100 fixed entries), SESSION-TABLE (50 fixed entries)
3. **String Handling**: PIC X(20) = exactly 20 characters with space-padding
4. **Constraints**: Max 100 users, max 50 sessions
5. **Error Messages**: Exact text that must be preserved
6. **Edge Cases**: Duplicate checks, capacity limits, token validation

**Tool pattern**:
- Open file in IDE → Claude Code reads it automatically
- Ask behavioral questions → Claude Code analyzes semantics (not just syntax)
- Request test generation → Claude Code extracts requirements

---

## How I Generated the Python Version

**Approach**: Let Claude Code handle implementation autonomously after defining requirements

**Process**:
1. **Phase 1**: Created behavioral spec first (requirements before code)
2. **Phase 2**: Created comprehensive test suite (27 black-box tests)
3. **Phase 3**: Claude Code generated `modern_app.py` that:
   - Implements `UserManagementSystem` class
   - Preserves exact COBOL behavior (20-char strings, error messages, capacity limits)
   - Uses modern Python patterns (type hints, OOP)
   - Passes 100% of tests

**Key insight**: Test-first approach prevented confirmation bias - tests defined "correct" before implementation

---

## What Prompts I Used

### Strategic Planning
```
"First explain me what should be my steps and strategy for migration"
```
**Result**: Got 5-phase strategic plan

### Validation
```
"Are all these cases covered in behavioral_spec.md?
- All operations (register, login, change password)
- Edge cases (duplicate user, full DB, invalid token)
- Expected behaviors (what MUST be preserved)"
```
**Result**: Confirmed coverage and found gaps

### Gap Identification
```
"any other possibility of any edge case left? where are details of full DB?"
```
**Result**: Found 7 additional edge cases and added detailed DB capacity section

### Phase Progression
```
"Lets move with next phase"
```
**Result**: Smooth progression through all 8 phases

## What Worked

✅ **Strategic Planning First**
- Claude Code provided clear 5-phase roadmap before writing code
- Prevented rework and ensured alignment

✅ **Autonomous Multi-File Execution**
- Created 8 files (~2,300 lines) without manual intervention
- Handled complex dependencies between files

✅ **Deep COBOL Behavioral Analysis**
- Extracted subtle behaviors (duplicate check priority, token generation timing)
- Identified 25+ edge cases from static code analysis
- Documented COBOL line references for traceability

✅ **Self-Debugging**
- Detected Windows encoding issues automatically
- Fixed Unicode characters across multiple files
- Re-ran tests to validate fixes

✅ **Comprehensive Test Generation**
- Created 27 black-box tests covering all scenarios
- Tests work for ANY Python implementation
- Achieved 100% pass rate

✅ **Validation-Driven Interaction**
- Responded to my completeness checks by finding missing edge cases
- Accepted specific feedback (line selections, pointed questions)

---

## What Didn't Work

⚠️ **Unicode Characters on Windows**
- **Problem**: Emoji characters (checkmarks, arrows) in test docstrings caused `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows
- **Fix**: Claude Code replaced all emojis with ASCII equivalents automatically
- **Intervention needed**: None - self-corrected

⚠️ **Initial Edge Case Coverage**
- **Problem**: First version of `behavioral_spec.md` missed 7 edge cases
- **Fix**: I asked: "any other possibility of any edge case left?"
- Claude Code re-analyzed and found additional scenarios
- **Intervention needed**: Single validation prompt
